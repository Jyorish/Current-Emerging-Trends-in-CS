# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
In this project, I created a deep Q-Learning environment to enable the agent to complete the task in as few moves as possible. We were provided with code snippets and a pseudocode outline to complete the task. I developed the Python code in alignment with the provided pseudocode to complete the project.
# Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists design and create computer components to solve issues in everyday life and find systematic ways to solve problems efficiently.
# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I approach problems as a computer scientist by first analyzing the problem, then considering possible solutions. Afterward, I account for additional factors, such as security, ethics, and environmental impact. Once satisfied with my approach, I implement the analysis to create a solution.
# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
Ethical responsibility is essential because negligence can impact not only the end user or organization but also the broader society. Such impact can trigger a domino effect, resulting in larger concerns.
